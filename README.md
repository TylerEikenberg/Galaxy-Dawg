For my game I decided to try to recreate a game in the style of the classic Atari game __Space Invaders__ and  the Tecmo game __Raiden__. To do this I had to learn how to use the JavaScript framework [Phaser](https://phaser.io/).
[Click here](https://tylereikenberg.github.io/Galaxy-Dawg/) to play!  
  
In it's current state __Galaxy Dawg__ is a top down shoot-em up style game where the goal is to survive as long as possible and get the highest score. The game will save your highest score, feel free to [send me a screenshot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-eikenberg-0b834a191/) of your highest score! 

### How to Play  
Gameplay for __Galaxy Dawg__ is very easy and can be played with the __left__ and __right__ keys of your keyboard or the __mouse__. It can even be played on your smartphone!
